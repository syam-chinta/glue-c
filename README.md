Title:

Public Services Automated Policy Document Summarizer and Q&A Agent

TATA

Problem Statement:

Citizens and public servants face challenges understanding lengthy and complex policy documents, hindering transparency and compliance. Manual summarization is slow and often lacks accessibility. An Al agent capable of generating concise summaries and answering policy-related questions in natural language would enhance public engagement and administrative efficiency. This solution democratizes access to critical information and reduces workload for public service staff.

Data Requirements:

Official policy documents in text or PDF formats from government portals. Metadata including issue date, department, and policy category. Historical FAQs and citizen inquiries for training conversational context. Multilingual data if applicable.

(Feel free to generate synthetic data as well from the provided access)

Expected Output:

The deliverable is a web-based agent providing document summaries and an interactive Q&A interface. Outputs include bullet-point summaries formatted for easy reading, and conversational responses to policy questions with references to source sections. Users can export summaries and Q&A transcripts as PDFs.
